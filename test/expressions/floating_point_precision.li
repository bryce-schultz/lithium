# Test floating-point precision handling
# These tests verify that common floating-point precision issues are handled correctly

# Classic floating-point precision issue
println(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3);  # Should be true

# Multiple operations
println(0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.3);  # Should be true
println(0.1 + 0.2 + 0.3 == 0.6);  # Should be true

# Integer vs float comparisons
println(1.0 == 1);  # Should be true
println(0.0 == 0);  # Should be true
println(10.0 == 10);  # Should be true

# Cases that should NOT be equal
println(0.1 == 0.2);  # Should be false
println(0.3 == 0.4);  # Should be false
println(0.30001 == 0.3);  # Should be false (difference too large for epsilon)

# Display formatting
print("0.1 + 0.2 = ");
println(0.1 + 0.2);  # Should display as 0.3, not 0.30000000000000004
