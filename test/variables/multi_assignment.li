# Test multi-assignment scenarios

# Test 1: Initial declaration with multi-assignment (should work)
let b = 10;
let a = b = 5;
println("a =", a);
println("b =", b);

# Test 2: Multi-assignment on existing variables (currently broken, should be fixed)
a = b = 10;
println("after multi-assignment:");
println("a =", a);
println("b =", b);

# Test 3: Chain of assignments
let c = 20;
a = b = c = 15;
println("after chain assignment:");
println("a =", a);
println("b =", b);
println("c =", c);
